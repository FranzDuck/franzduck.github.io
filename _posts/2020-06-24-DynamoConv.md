## Idea

Wouldn't it be great to have your smartphone charged while driving your bike?
Even better, imagine to charge your smartphone while driving the bike without having to bring a powerbank?
Especially if you are using a smartphone as a navigation aid, you might have realized that the battery levels drop fast, so charging is really necessary if you are going on longer tours.
I thought the same and naturally started to search for products that might do this on the internet.
It turns out that there are quite a lot of chargers, but (at least for hub dynamos) they are ludicrously expensive.
